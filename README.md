# Unity Clean Game Template

This repo is a shortcut to professional Unity development.  
All core systems (input, player, enemy, UI, save, signals) are separated and easy to extend.  
Perfect for new projects, prototyping, or learning modern Unity patterns.

## Features

- **Zenject** for dependency injection (industry standard; easy to swap for VContainer)
- **LitMotionTween** for modern tweening ([MIT License](https://github.com/AnnulusGames/LitMotion))
- **Input abstraction** (easy to switch to mobile, gamepad, or web)
- **Object pooling** (ready for many enemies and bullets)
- **Decoupled signals/events** (testable, maintainable code)
- **Game state save/load** (via PlayerPrefs)
- **MIT License** – use, fork, and remix for any project

## Why Zenject and LitMotion?

- **Zenject** ([https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject)) is the de facto Unity DI standard, used in many production games.  
  You can swap it for VContainer or others; dependencies are abstracted.
- **LitMotionTween** ([https://github.com/AnnulusGames/LitMotion](https://github.com/AnnulusGames/LitMotion)) is chosen for its clean API, small size, active maintenance, and MIT license.
